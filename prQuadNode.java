//On my honor:
//
//- I have not discussed the Java language code in my program with
//anyone other than my instructor or the teaching assistants
//assigned to this course.
//
//- I have not used Java language code obtained from another student,
//or any other unauthorized source, including the Internet, either
//modified or unmodified.
//
//- If any Java language code or documentation used in my program
//was obtained from another source, such as a text book or course
//notes, that has been clearly noted with a proper citation in
//the comments of my program.
//
//- I have not designed this program in such a way as to defeat or
//interfere with the normal operation of the grading code.
